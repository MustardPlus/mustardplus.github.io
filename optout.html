"Features":
- Turn-Based Action Battle-System.
> Control a Party of up to 6 with max of 3 in-action at a time.
> See all Party Members at once in battles with the special "bench" mechanic. Let characters take a seat and others hop in using the bench. Characters benched will collectively have a turn of their own to assist the active members.
- Action, Action, Action. Overworld Interaction.
> Exploring the World of Opt-Out is not a simple walkaround experience. Freedom is in your hands to get dirty and see all you want. Jump all over the place or kick down all the trash you come across, it's up to you. With an interesting moveset, traveling place to place is something that feels more engaging in Opt-Out than any basic RPG. Walk, Run, Crouch, Hop, Leap, Kick, Float, Climb, Swing, but don't Drown!
- Several Leader Characters to play as. Many Party Members to meet. So many Allies to come gather. Endless enemies to be made.
> Each Leader character you take control of has their own way of interacting with the world. When seeing the world through new eyes, you may be happy to discover new skills only then possible. Each Leader may be friendly with entirely different groups of characters. Get exposed to new things.
> Special characters will join you as Party Members. Hang out with your new friends exploring everything unknown together.
> Certain characters can become Allies. Ally characters may temporarily join your party to assist in battles. Ally characters will have their own moves to carry out only if they choose to do so.
> All characters have unique specialties, skills, knowledge, etc. so be sure to always have strategy when approaching battles.
